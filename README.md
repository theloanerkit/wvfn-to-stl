# wvfn-to-stl
This code takes wavefunctions generated by [iDEA](https://github.com/iDEA-org/iDEA) and converts them into an STL file for 3D printing.

To use, save the real space wavefunction from iDEA using
```
pickle.dump(state.space.real,open([fname]))
```
Then run ```main.py```, passing it the same filename (excluding the .pkl). Your STL of the same name will be generated and saved!

### optional keywords:
```scale:``` wvfn-to-stl can take a scale parameter when generating the STL. By default it is set to ```300```. It multiplies all values in the wavefunction (otherwise the STL is very flat). Increase for a spikier model, and decrease for a flatter one.

```thickness:``` this adjusts the gap created between the upper face and the lower face. If there are bits missing when slicing your STL, try increasing the thickness parameter. (By default it is set to ```12```.)
